# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository in JavaScript! This repository is a collection of various 
data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript, providing a valuable resource for learning and understanding 
fundamental concepts in computer science.

### Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms
- [x] **Single Linked List**
- [x] **Doubly Linked List**

### Future Implementations
I'm continuously working to expand the collection of data structures 
and algorithms in this repository. Future implementations may include:

- [ ] **Stack**
- [ ] **Queue**
- [ ] **Binary Search Tree**
- [ ] **Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)**
- [ ] **Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)**

*Stay tuned for updates as I continue to add more implementations to this repository.*
