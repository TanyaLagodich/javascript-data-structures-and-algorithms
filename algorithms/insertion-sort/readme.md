# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array
one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more
advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However,
it performs well for small datasets or lists that are mostly sorted.

## Function Parameters

`array`: The array to be sorted.

## Performance

Insertion Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)`. 
It is more efficient on smaller datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
