# Bubble Sort

A simple and efficient sorting algorithm based on the principle of sequentially
comparing and swapping adjacent elements in an array. Bubble Sort iteratively 
traverses the array multiple times, compares pairs of adjacent elements, 
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the 
entire array is sorted.

## Function Parameters
`array`: The array to be sorted.

## Performance
In the worst-case scenario, Bubble Sort has quadratic time complexity O(n^2), 
making it less efficient for large arrays. However, it is straightforward 
to implement and may be useful for small datasets.
