# Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides an array 
into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges 
the sorted halves to produce a sorted array. 
It is a stable sorting algorithm and guarantees O(n log n) time 
complexity, making it efficient for large datasets.

## Function Parameters
`array`: The array to be sorted.

## Performance
Merge Sort guarantees a time complexity of `O(n log n)` in all cases, 
making it more efficient than quadratic time sorting algorithms 
for large datasets.

Time complexity is `O(n)`
